              I began my career as an intern at GoWebeZ , Guindy, where I was
              soon selected as a Full Stack Developer. During my 8-month tenure,
              I gained hands-on experience in a range of technologies including
              Laravel, MySQL, jQuery, and more. This opportunity gave me a
              strong foundation in both frontend and backend development,
              project collaboration, and real-world application building. Since
              then, I've been actively working as a freelancer, crafting
              solutions for clients and continuing to refine my skills across
              the full stack. <br />
              <br /> My key strengths include: Adapting quickly to new
              technologies and tools. Delivering responsive, user-friendly
              interfaces. Writing clean, scalable backend code. Integrating
              third-party services and APIs efficiently. Collaborating on
              projects with both startups and solo clients. Currently, Iâ€™m
              looking for my next exciting opportunity where I can grow,
              contribute, and help bring digital ideas to life with high-quality
              code and creative problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion for coding keeps me pushing boundaries to create
              better, more innovative solutions every day. I thrive in
              environments where I can continuously learn and contribute to
              building something impactful.
